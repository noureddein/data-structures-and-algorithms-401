  - SLL is faster for insertion and deletion at the beginning (Big-O(1)).
  - SLL use the space when it is needed, in opposite of array.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
  - Implementing **Node** class.
  - Implementing **Linked List** class.
  - Create insert method, to insert at the beginning.
  - Create include method to search for a value.
  - Create a method for printing elements. 

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
