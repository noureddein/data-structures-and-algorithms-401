# Singly Linked List (SLL)
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
  - SLL is a linear data structure.
  - SLL is faster for insertion and deletion at the beginning (Big-O(1)).
  - SLL use the space when it is needed, in opposite of array.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
  - **Lab class 05**
      - Implementing **Node** class.
      - Implementing **Linked List** class.
      - Create insert method, to insert at the beginning.
      - Create include method to search for a value.
      - Create a method for printing elements.
  - **Lab class 06**
      - Create insert before method, to insert before a specific node.
      - Create insert after method, to insert after a specific node.
      - Create append method, to insert a node at the last of linked list.
      - Create a delete method, to delete a specific node.
