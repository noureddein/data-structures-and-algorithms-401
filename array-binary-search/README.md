# Binary Search of Sorted Array
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
  - Write a function called **BinarySearch** which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Return the index of the array’s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
  - What approach did you take?
    - Half the array to find the element.
    - this approach will decrease the amount of search.
  - What is the Big O space/time for this approach?
    - Big-O (log n)
